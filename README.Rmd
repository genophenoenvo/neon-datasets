### 1. Plant cover

The final curated dataset contains plant cover values by species at all NEON sites. 

#### Original data

- **Plant presence and percent cover** dataset 
- Product ID *DP1.10058.001*
- [Data portal link](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10058.001)
- Summary: Plant cover for each species of plant was estimated in six 1m2 subplots within 400m2 plots, where plant cover was percent of subplot ground covered as viewed from above. Each site has around 30 plots, with sites distributed across the USA. Plant cover was taken multiple times per year over multiple years, depending on the site. 
- Additional useful information
  - Some plants have vouchers/tissues collected that may be useful for genetic analyses
  - The only data for plant height is `heightPlantOver300cm`, which indicates whether plants are taller than 9.8 feet

#### File structure

- `plant_cover` folder
  - Scripts
    - `curate_data.R` cleans up data
  - Derived data and figures
    - `plant_cover.csv` is curated data

#### Curated data details

Columns: 

- `species`: species identification
- `lat`: latitude of plot (decimal degrees)
- `lon`: longitude of plot (decimal degrees)
- `sitename`: site, plot, and subplot info combined in format `sitecode_plotID_subplotID`; e.g., `DSNY_DSNY_017_32.4.1` is site DSNY, plot 017, subplot 32.4.1
- `date`: date of end of sampling in format YYYY-MM-DD
- `canopy_cover`: amount of ground covered by that species in 1m2 area (%)
- `uid`: unique identifier for each record as assigned by NEON

### 2. Phenology measurements

The final curated dataset contains first date for each individual of at least half of flowers open for species from an NPN list at all NEON sites, combined with the corresponding NEON-collected meteorological data. 

#### Original data

**Plant phenology observations** dataset 

- Product ID *DP1.10055.001*
- [Data portal link](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.10055.001)
- Summary: Phenophase status recorded for ~100 individual plants at each site across multiple years. Records are made for all plants up to multiple times a week depending on phenology activity. Each site has one transect along which all plants are included, with each individual plant tracked across each year. Tracked phenophases include initial growth, young leaves/needles, open flowers/pollen cones, colored leaves/needles, and falling leaves/needles. 

**Precipitation** dataset 

- Product ID *DP1.00006.001*
- [Data portal link](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00006.001)
- Summary: Three methods of measuring precipiation were used, with only one or two used at some sites. Primary measurements were with a weighing gauge, second measurements with a tipping bucket on the tower, and throughfall measurements with tipping buckets on the ground. Both primary and throughfall methods were known to have errors in the data. 

**Relative humidity** dataset 

- Product ID *DP1.00098.001*
- [Data portal link](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.00098.001)
- Summary: At each NEON site, a Vaisala probe sensor collected relative humidity, air temperature, and dew point temperature measurements at every minute and 30 minutes at multiple locations, including one on the tower at the site. There are missing datapoints for all sites.
