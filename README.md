# Black cottonwood phenophases
This repository contains data and analysis regarding phenophase data from the black cottonwood (*Populus trichocarpa*) from four common gardens and provisioned by Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Common gardens were surveyed in the spring for bud break and in the fall for bud set.
